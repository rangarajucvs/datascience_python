Install Python 3.5 or newer on your machine.
As root user
# yum install -y https://centos7.iuscommunity.org/ius-release.rpm
# yum update -y
# yum install -y python36u python36u-libs python36u-devel python36u-pip
# which -a python3.6
   Output:
       /usr/bin/python3.6
       /bin/python3.6

Use venv (that comes with python 3.3 and above) for each of your project so you
can have separate virtual environment for each of your projects.

Commands to run are as follows:
# python3.6 -m venv /opt/data_analysis/venv
# cd /opt/data_analysis/
# source venv/bin/activate
# which python
Now you will notice you are using python of the virtual env
# deactivate
It will deactivate the virtual env python
# which python3.6
It will now show the system python path.
So re-activate virtual env using below command.
# cd /opt/data_analysis/;source venv/bin/activate
# pip install python-twitter
# pip uninstall python-twitter
# pip install python-twitter
          OR
# pip install git+git://github.com/bear/python-twitter

requirements.txt file to be created with following content so pip can install them for us.
   jupyter
   nltk
   numpy
   pandas
   PyQt5
   python-twitter
   SQLAlchemy
# pip install -r requirements.txt
Now the Python and necessary pip libraries we need are all installed and setup.
